In C#, an anonymous type is a type that does not have a name and is automatically generated by the compiler. Anonymous types are typically used for storing a set of read-only properties and are useful when you need a simple container to hold a few related values temporarily.

```ad-note
All anonymous types are automatically derived from System.Object and, therefore, support each of the members provided by this base class. Given this, you could invoke ToString(), GetHashCode(), Equals(), or GetType() on the implicitly typed myCar object.
```

```ad-note
It is possible to create an anonymous type that is composed of other anonymous types.
```

### Syntax

The syntax for defining an anonymous type in C# is straightforward:

```csharp
var anonymousObject = new { Property1 = value1, Property2 = value2, ... };
```

In this syntax:
- `var` keyword is used to declare an anonymous type because you don't explicitly specify the type name.
- `new { ... }` creates a new instance of an anonymous type.
- `Property1`, `Property2`, etc., are properties of the anonymous type.
- `value1`, `value2`, etc., are the values assigned to each property.

### Example

Here's an example of using an anonymous type to store information about a person:

```csharp
var person = new { FirstName = "John", LastName = "Doe", Age = 30 };

Console.WriteLine($"Name: {person.FirstName} {person.LastName}, Age: {person.Age}");
```

In this example:
- We create an anonymous type with properties `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Age`.
- The properties are initialized with specific values ("John", "Doe", and 30, respectively).
- We then access these properties using dot notation (`person.FirstName`, `person.LastName`, `person.Age`) just like accessing properties of any other object.

### Usage

Anonymous types are often used in LINQ queries to store temporary results or to shape data before further processing. For example:

```csharp
var employees = new []
{
    new { FirstName = "John", LastName = "Doe", Age = 30 },
    new { FirstName = "Jane", LastName = "Smith", Age = 25 }
};

var filteredEmployees = employees.Where(e => e.Age > 28);

foreach (var emp in filteredEmployees)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Name: {emp.FirstName} {emp.LastName}, Age: {emp.Age}");
}
```

In this usage:
- An array `employees` of anonymous types is created to store information about employees.
- A LINQ query (`Where`) filters employees based on a condition (`Age > 28`).
- The filtered results (`filteredEmployees`) are iterated over to print the names and ages of employees who meet the condition.

### Characteristics

- **Read-only Properties:** Properties of anonymous types are read-only, meaning you can't modify them after they are initialized.
- **Compiler Generated:** The compiler generates a new type for each unique anonymous type declaration. Therefore, each anonymous type instance is its own type.
- **Limited Scope:** Anonymous types are typically used locally within a method or a LINQ query where their simplicity and lack of explicit definition are advantageous.

### Limitations

- **No Explicit Typing:** Since anonymous types don't have a name, you can't declare methods or create instances explicitly using the type name.
- **Limited Usability:** They are primarily suited for short-lived data structures and are not suitable for scenarios requiring wider accessibility or more complex behaviors.

Anonymous types are handy for temporary data structures where you need to aggregate data or perform quick transformations without defining formal classes. Their simplicity and ease of use make them a convenient tool in C# programming, especially in scenarios involving data projection and transformation.
