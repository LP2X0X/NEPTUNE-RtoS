## Example
```csharp
// Make 2 anonymous classes with identical name/value pairs.  
var firstCar = new { Color = "Bright Pink", Make = "Saab", CurrentSpeed = 55 };  
var secondCar = new { Color = "Bright Pink", Make = "Saab", CurrentSpeed = 55 };  

// Are they considered equal when using Equals()?  
if (firstCar.Equals(secondCar))  
{  
	Console.WriteLine("Same anonymous object!");  
}  
else  
{  
	Console.WriteLine("Not the same anonymous object!");  
}
```

In the provided example, the console prints "Same anonymous object!" because the two anonymous objects `firstCar` and `secondCar` have identical name/value pairs for their properties (`Color`, `Make`, and `CurrentSpeed`). 

Let's break down why this happens:

1. **Anonymous Types in C#:** When you create anonymous types in C#, the compiler generates a unique type for each declaration based on the properties specified. Although they don't have a named class, their structure is defined by the properties and their types.

2. **Equality Comparison for Anonymous Types:** By default, anonymous types in C# override the `Equals` method to compare their properties for equality. This means that two anonymous type instances are considered equal if all their corresponding properties have equal values.

3. **Property Values in the Example:** 
   - `firstCar` and `secondCar` are declared with identical properties and values:
     ```csharp
     var firstCar = new { Color = "Bright Pink", Make = "Saab", CurrentSpeed = 55 };
     var secondCar = new { Color = "Bright Pink", Make = "Saab", CurrentSpeed = 55 };
     ```
   - Both `firstCar` and `secondCar` have the same `Color`, `Make`, and `CurrentSpeed` values.

4. **Equals Method Behavior:** When you call `Equals()` on `firstCar` and pass `secondCar` as the argument:
   - The overridden `Equals` method for anonymous types compares each property of `firstCar` with the corresponding property in `secondCar`.
   - Since all properties (`Color`, `Make`, and `CurrentSpeed`) have the same values in both `firstCar` and `secondCar`, the `Equals()` method returns `true`.

5. **Console Output:** Because `firstCar.Equals(secondCar)` returns `true`, the condition `if (firstCar.Equals(secondCar))` evaluates to `true`. Therefore, the code prints "Same anonymous object!".

### Conclusion

In C#, anonymous types are considered equal if they have the same set of properties with equal values. This behavior allows for straightforward equality comparison of anonymous objects based on their content, making them useful for scenarios where you need simple, temporary data structures without the need for explicit class definitions.

```csharp
// Are they considered equal when using ==?  
if (firstCar == secondCar)  
{  
	Console.WriteLine("Same anonymous object!");  
}  
else  
{  
	Console.WriteLine("Not the same anonymous object!");  
}
# Not the same anonymous object!
```

- This might seem at first glance to be a bit counterintuitive. This result is because anonymous types do not receive overloaded versions of the C# equality operators (== and !=). Given this, when you test for equality of anonymous types using the C# equality operators (rather than the Equals() method), the references, not the values maintained by the objects, are being tested for equality.

---
```csharp
// Are these objects the same underlying type?  
if (firstCar.GetType().Name == secondCar.GetType().Name)  
{  
	Console.WriteLine("We are both the same type!");  
}  
else  
{  
	Console.WriteLine("We are different types!");  
}
```
- Finally, in the final conditional test (where you examine the underlying type name), you find  that the anonymous types are instances of the same compiler-generated class type (in this example,  \<>f AnonymousType0\`3) because firstCar and secondCar have the same properties (Color, Make, and  CurrentSpeed).
- This illustrates an important but subtle point: the compiler will generate a new class definition only when an anonymous type contains unique names of the anonymous type. Thus, if you declare identical anonymous types (again, meaning the same names) within the same assembly, the compiler generates only a single anonymous type definition.

---
The concept of "same name" in the context of anonymous types refers to the names of the properties within the anonymous type declaration. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

### Anonymous Type Definition

In C#, when you declare an anonymous type using `new { ... }`, the compiler generates a new type behind the scenes based on the properties specified within the braces. For example:

```csharp
var firstCar = new { Color = "Bright Pink", Make = "Saab", CurrentSpeed = 55 };
var secondCar = new { Color = "Bright Pink", Make = "Saab", CurrentSpeed = 55 };
```

In this case, `firstCar` and `secondCar` are both instances of anonymous types with the same structure (same properties with the same names and types).

### Compiler Behavior

When the compiler encounters the declaration of an anonymous type, it generates a new class definition for that specific combination of property names and types. However, if the compiler encounters another declaration of an anonymous type with exactly the same property names and types within the same assembly, it reuses the existing generated class definition instead of creating a new one.

### Example Clarification

Let's clarify with an example:

```csharp
var firstCar = new { Color = "Bright Pink", Make = "Saab", CurrentSpeed = 55 };
var secondCar = new { Color = "Bright Pink", Make = "Saab", CurrentSpeed = 55 };
```

- Here, `firstCar` and `secondCar` have identical property names (`Color`, `Make`, `CurrentSpeed`) with the same types (`string` for `Color` and `Make`, `int` for `CurrentSpeed`).

- Despite being declared in two separate lines, both `firstCar` and `secondCar` use the same generated anonymous type definition because they have the exact same property names and types.

### Importance of Property Names

The "same names" part refers to the property names within the anonymous type declaration. If you were to change a property name in either `firstCar` or `secondCar`, even if the types and values remain the same, the compiler would generate a new anonymous type definition for that specific declaration because the property names are different.

### Benefits

- **Type Safety:** Anonymous types provide type safety at compile time while still allowing flexibility in defining new types on-the-fly.
  
- **Convenience:** They are convenient for scenarios like LINQ queries where you need to project specific properties without defining a formal class.

### Limitations

- **Limited Scope:** Anonymous types are scoped to the method or block where they are declared and cannot be used outside of that scope.
  
- **Immutable:** Properties within anonymous types are read-only, meaning you cannot modify their values once initialized.

### Conclusion

Understanding that anonymous types in C# are generated based on property names (and types) helps clarify why identical anonymous type declarations within the same assembly share the same underlying type definition. This behavior optimizes compilation and runtime performance by reusing existing type definitions when possible, ensuring efficiency in memory and execution.
