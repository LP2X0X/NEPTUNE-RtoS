- When you establish “is-a” relationships between classes, you are building a dependency between two or more class types. The basic idea behind classical inheritance is that new classes can be created using existing classes as a starting point.
- The existing class that will serve as the basis for the new class is termed a base class, superclass, or parent class. The role of a base class is to define all the common data and members for the classes that extend it. The extending classes are formally termed derived or child classes.

```ad-note
it is important to keep in mind that C# demands that a given class have exactly one direct base class.
