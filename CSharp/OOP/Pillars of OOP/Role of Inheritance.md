The next pillar of OOP, inheritance, boils down to the language’s ability to allow you to build new class definitions based on existing class definitions. In essence, inheritance allows you to extend the behavior of a base (or parent) class by inheriting core functionality into the derived subclass (also called a child class).
When you have classes related by this form of inheritance, you establish “is-a” relationships between types. The “is-a” relationship is termed inheritance.
There is another form of code reuse in the world of OOP: the containment/delegation model also known as the “has-a” relationship or aggregation. This form of reuse is not used to establish parent-child relationships. Rather, the “has-a” relationship allows one class to define a member variable of another class and expose its functionality (if required) to the object user indirectly.
