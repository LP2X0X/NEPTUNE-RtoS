The final pillar of OOP is polymorphism. This trait captures a language’s ability to treat related objects in a similar manner. Specifically, this tenant of an object-oriented language allows a base class to define a set of members (formally termed the polymorphic interface) that are available to all descendants. A class’s polymorphic interface is constructed using any number of virtual or abstract members.
In a nutshell, a virtual member is a member in a base class that defines a default implementation that may be changed (or more formally speaking, overridden) by a derived class. In contrast, an abstract method is a member in a base class that does not provide a default implementation but does provide a signature. When a class derives from a base class defining an abstract method, it must be overridden by a derived type. In either case, when derived types override the members defined by a base class, they are essentially redefining how they respond to the same request.
