Objects must be allocated into memory using the new keyword.
```csharp
Car myCar;  
myCar = new Car();  
myCar.petName = "Fred";  
```
Here, the first code statement simply declares a reference to a yet-to-be-determined Car object. It is not until you assign a reference to an object that this reference points to a valid object in memory.
