A contextual keyword is used to provide a specific meaning in the code, but it isn't a reserved word in C#. Some contextual keywords, such as `partial` and `where`, have special meanings in two or more contexts.
```ad-example
Within a set scope of a property, you use a token named value, which is used to represent the incoming value used to assign the property by the caller. This token is not a true C# keyword but is what is known as a contextual keyword. When the token value is within the set scope of the property, it always represents the value being assigned by the caller, and it will always be the same underlying data type as the property itself.
