- Unlike a constant field, read-only fields are not implicitly static. Thus, if you want to expose PI from the class level, you must explicitly use the static keyword. If you know the value of a static read-only field at compile time, the initial assignment looks similar to that of a constant (however, in this case, it would be easier to simply use the const keyword in the first place, as you are assigning the data field at the time of declaration).
- However, if the value of a static read-only field is not known until runtime, you must use a static constructor as described earlier in this chapter.
