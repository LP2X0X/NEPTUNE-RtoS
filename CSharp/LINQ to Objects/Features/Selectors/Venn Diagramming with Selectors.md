LINQ in C# also provides `ExceptBy`, `IntersectBy`, and `UnionBy` methods, which are useful when you need to perform set operations based on a specific key. These methods allow you to specify a key selector function to determine how the elements are compared.

### LINQ Set Operations with Key Selectors

1. **UnionBy**: Combines two sets to include all distinct elements from both sets based on a specified key.
2. **IntersectBy**: Returns only the elements that are present in both sets based on a specified key.
3. **ExceptBy**: Returns elements that are in the first set but not in the second set based on a specified key.

### Example Definitions and Usage

#### 1. UnionBy

Combines elements from two collections, removing duplicates based on a key.

```csharp
var setA = new List<Person>
{
    new Person { Id = 1, Name = "Alice" },
    new Person { Id = 2, Name = "Bob" }
};

var setB = new List<Person>
{
    new Person { Id = 2, Name = "Bob" },
    new Person { Id = 3, Name = "Charlie" }
};

var unionBy = setA.UnionBy(setB, person => person.Id);

foreach (var person in unionBy)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{person.Id}, {person.Name}"); // Output: 1, Alice  2, Bob  3, Charlie
}
```

#### 2. IntersectBy

Finds common elements between two collections based on a key.

```csharp
var setA = new List<Person>
{
    new Person { Id = 1, Name = "Alice" },
    new Person { Id = 2, Name = "Bob" }
};

var setB = new List<Person>
{
    new Person { Id = 2, Name = "Bob" },
    new Person { Id = 3, Name = "Charlie" }
};

var intersectBy = setA.IntersectBy(setB, person => person.Id);

foreach (var person in intersectBy)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{person.Id}, {person.Name}"); // Output: 2, Bob
}
```

#### 3. ExceptBy

Finds elements in one collection that are not in the other based on a key.

```csharp
var setA = new List<Person>
{
    new Person { Id = 1, Name = "Alice" },
    new Person { Id = 2, Name = "Bob" }
};

var setB = new List<Person>
{
    new Person { Id = 2, Name = "Bob" },
    new Person { Id = 3, Name = "Charlie" }
};

var exceptBy = setA.ExceptBy(setB, person => person.Id);

foreach (var person in exceptBy)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{person.Id}, {person.Name}"); // Output: 1, Alice
}
```

### Defining the Person Class

For the examples above, the `Person` class is defined as follows:

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

### Summary

Using `UnionBy`, `IntersectBy`, and `ExceptBy`, you can perform set operations based on specific keys, allowing for more granular and meaningful comparisons of complex objects. These methods are particularly useful when working with collections of objects where comparisons should be made based on one or more properties rather than the entire object.

These key-based set operations extend the functionality and flexibility of LINQ, making it even more powerful for data manipulation and querying in C#. They allow developers to handle more complex scenarios easily, ensuring that LINQ remains a versatile and efficient tool for working with collections.
