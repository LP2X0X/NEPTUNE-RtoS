- Chunk() is another new method for paging has been added in .NET 6/C# 10. This method takes one parameter (size) and then splits the source into an Enumerable of Enumerables. For example, if we take the ProductInfo list and apply Chunk(2), the return value is a list of three lists, each inner list containing two records. If the list canâ€™t be split evenly, the last list will hold fewer records.
