- New to C# 10, the DefaultIfEmpty() method returns the elements of the sequence or a default value if the sequence is empty.
- This method is implemented by using deferred execution. The immediate return value is an object that stores all the information that is required to perform the action. The query represented by this method is not executed until the object is enumerated either by calling its `GetEnumerator` method directly or by using `foreach` in C# or `For Each` in Visual Basic.
- The default value for reference and nullable types is `null`.

### Example

```csharp
List<int> numbers = new List<int>();

foreach (int number in numbers.DefaultIfEmpty())
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}

/*
 This code produces the following output:

 0
*/
```
