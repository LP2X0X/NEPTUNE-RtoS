When an object has been "disposed," it remains in memory until the garbage collector reclaims it. This means that even after calling `Dispose`, it is technically possible for a client to continue invoking methods or accessing properties on the object. However, because the resources managed by the object have been released, such interactions can lead to unexpected behavior or exceptions. To prevent this, a robust resource wrapper class should implement a mechanism to gracefully handle calls to its members after disposal.

### Ensuring Safe Usage After Disposal

To make a resource wrapper robust, you should:

1. **Introduce a Disposed Check**: Implement a private field to track whether the object has been disposed.
2. **Throw ObjectDisposedException**: Update each member (method or property) to check if the object is disposed. If it is, throw an `ObjectDisposedException` to indicate that the operation is invalid.

### Example Implementation

Here’s a step-by-step implementation of a robust resource wrapper class that includes checks for disposal:

#### Step 1: Track Disposal Status

Introduce a private boolean field `disposed` to track whether the object has been disposed:

```csharp
private bool disposed = false;
```

#### Step 2: Modify Dispose Method

Update the `Dispose` method to set the `disposed` flag:

```csharp
public void Dispose()
{
    Dispose(true);
    GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
}

protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
{
    if (!disposed)
    {
        if (disposing)
        {
            // Dispose managed resources
        }

        // Dispose unmanaged resources

        disposed = true;
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Add Disposal Checks in Members

Add a method `CheckDisposed` to encapsulate the check logic, and call this method at the beginning of each member:

```csharp
private void CheckDisposed()
{
    if (disposed)
    {
        throw new ObjectDisposedException(GetType().FullName);
    }
}

public void SomeMethod()
{
    CheckDisposed();
    // Method logic here
}

public int SomeProperty
{
    get
    {
        CheckDisposed();
        // Property logic here
        return 0;
    }
    set
    {
        CheckDisposed();
        // Property logic here
    }
}
```

### Full Example

Here’s a full example that demonstrates the robust resource wrapper class:

```csharp
using System;

public class ResourceHolder : IDisposable
{
    private IntPtr unmanagedResource; // Unmanaged resource
    private bool disposed = false;

    public ResourceHolder()
    {
        unmanagedResource = AllocateUnmanagedResource();
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                // Dispose managed resources
            }

            // Dispose unmanaged resources
            if (unmanagedResource != IntPtr.Zero)
            {
                FreeUnmanagedResource(unmanagedResource);
                unmanagedResource = IntPtr.Zero;
            }

            disposed = true;
        }
    }

    ~ResourceHolder()
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }

    private void CheckDisposed()
    {
        if (disposed)
        {
            throw new ObjectDisposedException(GetType().FullName);
        }
    }

    public void SomeMethod()
    {
        CheckDisposed();
        // Method logic here
    }

    public int SomeProperty
    {
        get
        {
            CheckDisposed();
            // Property logic here
            return 0;
        }
        set
        {
            CheckDisposed();
            // Property logic here
        }
    }

    // PInvoke to allocate unmanaged resource
    [System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImport("UnmanagedLibrary.dll", CallingConvention = System.Runtime.InteropServices.CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
    private static extern IntPtr AllocateUnmanagedResource();

    // PInvoke to free unmanaged resource
    [System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImport("UnmanagedLibrary.dll", CallingConvention = System.Runtime.InteropServices.CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
    private static extern void FreeUnmanagedResource(IntPtr resource);
}
```

### Summary

1. **Disposal Flag**: Use a boolean flag to track whether the object has been disposed.
2. **Disposal Check**: Implement a method (`CheckDisposed`) to encapsulate the disposal check logic.
3. **Exception Handling**: Update each member to call `CheckDisposed` at the beginning and throw `ObjectDisposedException` if the object has been disposed.
4. **Dispose Pattern**: Ensure proper implementation of the dispose pattern, including managed and unmanaged resource cleanup.

This approach ensures that any attempt to use the disposed object will be met with a clear and immediate exception, preventing unpredictable behavior and making the class more robust and reliable.
