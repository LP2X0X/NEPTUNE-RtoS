No, `Dispose` and finalization do not both wait for the garbage collector to act. Here is an explanation of how `Dispose` and finalization work with respect to the garbage collector:

### Dispose Method

- **Explicit Call**: The `Dispose` method is called explicitly by the user or by a `using` statement. It does not involve the garbage collector.
- **Immediate Cleanup**: When `Dispose` is called, it immediately cleans up unmanaged resources and optionally managed resources. This happens in the current execution thread and does not wait for the garbage collector.
- **Suppress Finalization**: If the class has a finalizer, `Dispose` typically calls `GC.SuppressFinalize(this)` to prevent the garbage collector from calling the finalizer, as the resources have already been released.

### Finalization

- **Garbage Collector**: Finalization relies on the garbage collector to invoke the finalizer. The garbage collector places objects with finalizers on a special finalization queue when they become unreachable.
- **Delayed Cleanup**: The actual execution of the finalizer (`~ClassName()`) is deferred until the garbage collector runs, detects the unreachable objects, and processes the finalization queue. This can lead to a delay in resource cleanup.
- **Finalizer Thread**: The finalizer runs on a separate finalizer thread managed by the .NET runtime.

### Comparison

1. **Timing**:
   - **Dispose**: Immediate cleanup when called by the user.
   - **Finalizer**: Cleanup occurs when the garbage collector runs and processes the finalization queue.

2. **Invocation**:
   - **Dispose**: Explicitly called by the user or by a `using` statement.
   - **Finalizer**: Called implicitly by the garbage collector.

3. **Resource Management**:
   - **Dispose**: Suitable for deterministic cleanup of both managed and unmanaged resources.
   - **Finalizer**: Acts as a safety net for unmanaged resources if `Dispose` was not called.

### Example Without Waiting for Garbage Collector

Here's an example class implementing `IDisposable` with both `Dispose` and a finalizer:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class ResourceHolder : IDisposable
{
    private IntPtr unmanagedResource; // Unmanaged resource
    private bool disposed = false;

    public ResourceHolder()
    {
        // Allocate unmanaged resource
        unmanagedResource = AllocateUnmanagedResource();
    }

    // Public implementation of Dispose pattern callable by consumers
    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        // Suppress finalization since resources are already cleaned up
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    // Protected implementation of Dispose pattern
    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                // Free managed resources here, if any
            }

            // Free unmanaged resources
            if (unmanagedResource != IntPtr.Zero)
            {
                FreeUnmanagedResource(unmanagedResource);
                unmanagedResource = IntPtr.Zero;
            }

            disposed = true;
        }
    }

    // Destructor (finalizer)
    ~ResourceHolder()
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }

    // PInvoke to allocate unmanaged resource
    [DllImport("UnmanagedLibrary.dll", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
    private static extern IntPtr AllocateUnmanagedResource();

    // PInvoke to free unmanaged resource
    [DllImport("UnmanagedLibrary.dll", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
    private static extern void FreeUnmanagedResource(IntPtr resource);
}
```

### Usage Example

Using the `ResourceHolder` class:

```csharp
using (var holder = new ResourceHolder())
{
    // Use the holder
} // Dispose is called automatically at the end of the using block
// Immediate cleanup happens here without waiting for the garbage collector
```

### Summary

- **Dispose**: Does not wait for the garbage collector; it performs immediate cleanup when called explicitly.
- **Finalization**: Waits for the garbage collector to detect unreachable objects and then calls the finalizer on a separate thread, which can delay resource cleanup.
- **Best Practices**: Use `Dispose` for timely cleanup and to avoid relying on finalization for releasing unmanaged resources. Implement finalization only as a safety net for unmanaged resources.
