- There are multiple reasons. Just imagine you have a lot of super-small holes in your memory and you try to create new objects which would be bigger than that hole. Well, those small holes are then unusable. So you can get OutOfMemoryException even though there is enough (virtual) memory. Also, your CPU cache plays a major role here. Especially small and short-lived objects, which are in a sequential block of memory, have a higher chance of getting cached.
