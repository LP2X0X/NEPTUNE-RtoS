- There are two types of garbage collection provided by the runtime:
	 - **Workstation garbage collection**: This is designed for client applications and is the default for stand-alone applications. Workstation GC can be background (covered next) or nonconcurrent.
	 - **Server garbage collection**: This is designed for server applications that require high throughput and scalability. Server GC can be background or nonconcurrent, just like workstation GC.

```ad-note
The names are indicative of the default settings for workstation and server applications, but the method of garbage collection is configurable through the machineâ€™s runtimeconfig.json or system environment variables. Unless the computer has only one processor, then it will always use workstation garbage collection.
