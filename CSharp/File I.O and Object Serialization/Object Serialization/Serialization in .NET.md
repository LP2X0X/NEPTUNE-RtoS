- Serialization is the process of converting the state of an object into a form that can be persisted or transported. The complement of serialization is deserialization, which converts a stream into an object. Together, these processes allow data to be stored and transferred.
- Using this technology makes it trivial to save vast amounts of data. In many cases, saving application data using serialization services results in less code than using the readers/writers you find in the System.IO namespace.
