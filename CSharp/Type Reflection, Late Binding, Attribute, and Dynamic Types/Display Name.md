- Collectively speaking, the set of items identifying an assembly is termed the display name. The format of a display name is a comma-delimited string of name-value pairs that begins with the friendly name of the assembly, followed by optional qualifiers (that may appear in any order). Here is the template to follow (optional items appear in parentheses):  
```ad-note
Name (,Version = major.minor.build.revision) (,Culture = culture token) (,PublicKeyToken = public key token)
```
