- It is also possible to apply attributes on all types within a given assembly using the \[assembly:\] tag.

--- 

### Using a Separate File for Assembly Attributes
- Another approach is to add a new file to your project named similar to AssemblyAttributes.cs (any name will work, but that name conveys the purpose of the file) and place your assembly-level attributes in that file. In the .NET Framework, it was recommended to use AssemblyInfo.cs; however, with .NET (Core), that file canâ€™t be used. Placing the attributes in a separate file will make it easier for other developers to find the attributes applied to the project.

```ad-note
There are two significant changes in .NET. The first is that the AssemblyInfo.cs file is now autogenerated from the project properties and is not meant for developer use. The second (and related) change is that many of the prior assembly-level attributes (Version, Company, etc.) have been replaced with properties in the project file.

```csharp
using System;  
using System.Reflection;  
[assembly: System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleToAttribute("CSharpCarClient")]  
[assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyCompanyAttribute("Philip Japikse")]  
[assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyConfigurationAttribute("Debug")]  
[assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyDescriptionAttribute("This is a sample car library with attributes")]  
[assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyFileVersionAttribute("1.0.0.0")]  
[assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute("1.0.0")]  
[assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyProductAttribute("AttributedCarLibrary")]  
[assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyTitleAttribute("AttributedCarLibrary")]  
[assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyVersionAttribute("1.0.0.0")]
```
