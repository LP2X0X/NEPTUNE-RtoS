The `dynamic` keyword in C# provides flexibility by deferring type checking to runtime, but this flexibility comes with several limitations and potential pitfalls. Here are the key limitations of using the `dynamic` keyword:

### 1. **Runtime Errors**
Since `dynamic` bypasses compile-time type checking, errors that would normally be caught by the compiler are only detected at runtime. This can lead to runtime exceptions if methods or properties do not exist or are used incorrectly.

#### Example:
```csharp
dynamic obj = "Hello";
int length = obj.Length; // This works
obj = 123;
length = obj.Length; // Runtime error: 'int' does not contain a definition for 'Length'
```

### 2. **Performance Overhead**
The use of `dynamic` incurs a performance penalty because of the additional work required at runtime to resolve types and member access. This overhead can impact the performance of applications, especially in performance-critical scenarios.

### 3. **Lack of IntelliSense and Compile-Time Checking**
When using `dynamic`, most development environments (such as Visual Studio) cannot provide IntelliSense support or compile-time checking. This makes it harder to discover available members and methods and increases the risk of mistakes.

### 4. **Refactoring Challenges**
Refactoring tools rely on static type information to rename or reorganize code. Since `dynamic` defers type resolution to runtime, refactoring tools may not work effectively, leading to missed updates and potential bugs.

### 5. **Limited LINQ Support**
LINQ queries are statically typed, and the `dynamic` type does not work well with LINQ's compile-time type checking. This makes it challenging to use LINQ queries directly on `dynamic` types.

#### Example:
```csharp
dynamic list = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3 };
var result = list.Where(x => x > 1); // Compile-time error
```

### 6. **Complexity in Debugging**
Debugging dynamic code can be more challenging than statically typed code. Since the type information is not available at compile-time, tracking down the source of errors can be more difficult and time-consuming.

### 7. **Interoperability Issues**
While `dynamic` is useful for interoperability with COM objects and dynamic languages, it can lead to compatibility issues and unexpected behavior when interacting with strongly-typed code or libraries.

### 8. **Potential for Overuse**
The flexibility of `dynamic` can lead to its overuse, even in scenarios where static typing would be more appropriate. Overuse of `dynamic` can degrade code quality, maintainability, and readability.

### 9. **Challenges with Generics**
Using `dynamic` with generic methods or classes can be problematic, as the generic type constraints and resolutions rely on compile-time type information.

#### Example:
```csharp
public class MyClass<T>
{
    public void DoSomething(T item) { }
}

dynamic dynItem = "Hello";
var myClass = new MyClass<dynamic>();
myClass.DoSomething(dynItem); // This works, but may lead to complex issues
```

### Summary

The `dynamic` keyword in C# offers flexibility and is useful in scenarios where types are not known until runtime, such as COM interop, dynamic languages, or reflection. However, it comes with significant limitations:

1. **Prone to runtime errors**
2. **Performance overhead**
3. **Lack of IntelliSense and compile-time checking**
4. **Refactoring challenges**
5. **Limited LINQ support**
6. **Complexity in debugging**
7. **Interoperability issues**
8. **Potential for overuse**
9. **Challenges with generics**

Given these limitations, it is important to use `dynamic` judiciously and only in scenarios where its benefits outweigh its drawbacks. For most situations, sticking to static typing will provide better performance, safety, and maintainability.
