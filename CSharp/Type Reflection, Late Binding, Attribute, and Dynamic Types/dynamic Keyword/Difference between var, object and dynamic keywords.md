In C#, `var`, `object`, and `dynamic` are used for variable declarations, but they serve different purposes and have different behaviors regarding type safety and type resolution. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the differences between them:

### `var`

- **Type Inference at Compile Time**: The `var` keyword is used for implicit type declarations, where the compiler infers the type of the variable at compile time based on the assigned value.
- **Static Typing**: Variables declared with `var` are statically typed. Once the type is inferred, it cannot change.
- **IntelliSense and Compile-Time Checking**: The type is known at compile time, so you get full IntelliSense support and compile-time type checking.

#### Example:
```csharp
var number = 42;        // number is inferred to be of type int
var text = "Hello";     // text is inferred to be of type string

// The following would cause a compile-time error:
// var invalid = null;
```

### `object`

- **Base Type for All Types**: `object` is the base type for all types in C#. Any type, whether value type or reference type, can be assigned to an `object` variable.
- **Boxing and Unboxing**: Value types are boxed when assigned to an `object` and unboxed when retrieved.
- **Type Checking at Runtime**: Members of `object` variables are resolved at runtime. To access specific members of the actual type, you need to cast the `object` variable to the correct type.

#### Example:
```csharp
object obj = 42;       // Boxing the integer value
int number = (int)obj; // Unboxing the integer value

object strObj = "Hello";
string text = (string)strObj; // Casting required to access string members
```

### `dynamic`

- **Runtime Type Resolution**: The `dynamic` keyword tells the compiler to bypass compile-time type checking. The type and member resolution are deferred until runtime.
- **Flexible but Risky**: `dynamic` variables can change types at runtime and can have members dynamically added or removed. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of losing compile-time type safety and IntelliSense support.
- **Useful for Interop and Dynamic Scenarios**: `dynamic` is particularly useful for interacting with COM objects, dynamic languages, and scenarios where types are not known until runtime.

#### Example:
```csharp
dynamic dyn = 42;
dyn = "Hello";      // Changing type at runtime is allowed

// Members are resolved at runtime
Console.WriteLine(dyn.Length); // Will work if dyn is a string, but will cause a runtime error if dyn is an int
```

### Comparison

| Feature                   | `var`                        | `object`                      | `dynamic`                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Type Resolution           | Compile-time                 | Runtime (with casting)        | Runtime                        |
| Type Safety               | Static (compile-time)        | Static (runtime casting)      | Dynamic (runtime)              |
| IntelliSense Support      | Full                         | Limited (after casting)       | Limited (runtime)              |
| Use Case                  | When type is known           | General-purpose base type     | Interop, dynamic scenarios     |
| Type Flexibility          | Fixed after inference        | Fixed after assignment        | Flexible                       |
| Performance               | Better (no boxing/unboxing)  | May involve boxing/unboxing   | Potential runtime overhead     |

### Summary

- **`var`** is best used when the type is evident from the assignment, providing full compile-time type safety and IntelliSense support.
- **`object`** is a general-purpose base type for all types, requiring casting to access specific members and often involving boxing and unboxing for value types.
- **`dynamic`** offers runtime flexibility and is particularly useful for scenarios where the type is not known until runtime, such as COM interop or working with dynamic languages, but it comes with the risk of runtime errors and lack of compile-time checks.

Choose the appropriate keyword based on your specific needs for type safety, performance, and flexibility.
