- Simply put, late binding is a technique in which you can create an instance of a given type and invoke its members at runtime without having hard-coded compile-time knowledge of its existence. When you are building an application that binds late to a type in an external assembly, you have no reason to set a reference to the assembly; therefore, the callerâ€™s manifest has no direct listing of the assembly.
