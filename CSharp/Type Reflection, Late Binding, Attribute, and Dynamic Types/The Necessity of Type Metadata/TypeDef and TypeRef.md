- Each type defined within the current assembly is documented using a TypeDef \#n token (where TypeDef is short for type definition). If the type being described uses a type defined within a separate .NET assembly, the referenced type is documented using a TypeRef \#n token (where TypeRef is short for type reference).
- A TypeRef token is a pointer (if you will) to the referenced typeâ€™s full metadata definition in an external assembly. In a nutshell, .NET metadata is a set of tables that clearly mark all type definitions (TypeDefs) and referenced types (TypeRefs), all of which can be examined using ildasm.exe.
