The `global` keyword in the context of `using` directives is a feature introduced in C# 10. It allows you to specify that the `using` directive applies to the entire project, not just the file in which it appears. This means that the namespace or type specified in the `global using` directive will be available throughout all files in the project without needing to be explicitly imported in each file.

### Example Usage

If you add the following line to one of your project's files (often a common location is `Program.cs` or a dedicated file like `GlobalUsings.cs`):

```csharp
global using System.Text.Json;
```

The `System.Text.Json` namespace will be available in all files of your project without needing to add `using System.Text.Json;` at the top of each file.

### Benefits

1. **Convenience**: You don't have to repeatedly add the same `using` directives in multiple files.
2. **Consistency**: Ensures that commonly used namespaces are consistently available throughout the project.
3. **Cleaner Code**: Reduces the clutter at the top of each file by centralizing the import of common namespaces.

### Example Project Structure

Consider a project with the following files:

**GlobalUsings.cs**
```csharp
global using System.Text.Json;
global using System.Linq;
```

**Program.cs**
```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var jsonString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(new { Name = "Alice", Age = 30 });
        Console.WriteLine(jsonString);

        var numbers = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        var evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);
        foreach (var number in evenNumbers)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(number);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, both `System.Text.Json` and `System.Linq` are globally available, so they do not need to be explicitly imported in `Program.cs`.

### Summary

The `global` keyword in `global using` directives provides a way to make namespaces and types available project-wide, simplifying the codebase by reducing the need for repetitive `using` directives in individual files. This feature enhances convenience, consistency, and code cleanliness.
