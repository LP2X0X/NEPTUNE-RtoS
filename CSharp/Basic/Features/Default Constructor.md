In C#, a default constructor is a constructor that is automatically provided by the compiler if no other constructors are defined explicitly in a class. The default constructor has no parameters and initializes the object with default values, such as `0` for numeric types, `null` for reference types, and so on.

Here's an example of a class with a default constructor:

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public int MyProperty { get; set; }

    // This is the default constructor
    public MyClass()
    {
        // You can initialize properties or perform other initialization logic here
        MyProperty = 0; // Default value for MyProperty
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `MyClass` class defines a default constructor with no parameters.
- Inside the default constructor, the `MyProperty` property is initialized to `0`.

If you don't explicitly define any constructors in a class, the compiler will provide a default constructor automatically. However, if you define any constructors (including parameterized constructors), the compiler will not generate a default constructor, and you will need to provide one explicitly if you still want one.

Default constructors are useful for initializing objects with default values or performing any necessary initialization logic when the object is created. They ensure that objects are in a valid state when they are first created.
