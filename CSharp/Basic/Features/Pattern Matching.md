Pattern matching in C# is a powerful feature that enhances the language's ability to handle different types of data in a more readable and concise manner. It allows you to check the shape of data, extract values, and apply conditions in a way that improves code clarity and reduces the need for extensive if-else or switch-case statements.

### Types of Pattern Matching in C#

C# offers several types of pattern matching:

1. **Type Patterns**
2. **Constant Patterns**
3. **Property Patterns**
4. **Tuple Patterns**
5. **Positional Patterns**
6. **Relational Patterns**
7. **Logical Patterns**

### Examples and Usage

#### 1. Type Patterns

Type patterns check if an object is of a certain type and, if so, safely cast it to that type.

```csharp
object obj = "Hello, world!";
if (obj is string str)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"The string is: {str}");
}
```

#### 2. Constant Patterns

Constant patterns compare an object against a constant value.

```csharp
int number = 42;
if (number is 42)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The number is 42");
}
```

#### 3. Property Patterns

Property patterns allow you to match on the properties of an object.

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

Person person = new Person { Name = "Alice", Age = 30 };

if (person is { Name: "Alice", Age: 30 })
{
    Console.WriteLine("This is Alice, 30 years old.");
}
```

#### 4. Tuple Patterns

Tuple patterns allow you to match and deconstruct tuples.

```csharp
(int, int) point = (1, 2);

if (point is (1, 2))
{
    Console.WriteLine("The point is at (1, 2)");
}
```

#### 5. Positional Patterns

Positional patterns are used with deconstructing objects.

```csharp
public class Point
{
    public int X { get; }
    public int Y { get; }

    public Point(int x, int y)
    {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
    }

    public void Deconstruct(out int x, out int y)
    {
        x = X;
        y = Y;
    }
}

Point point = new Point(1, 2);

if (point is (1, 2))
{
    Console.WriteLine("The point is at (1, 2)");
}
```

#### 6. Relational Patterns

Relational patterns allow you to use relational operators within patterns.

```csharp
int age = 25;

if (age is > 18 and < 65)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The person is an adult.");
}
```

#### 7. Logical Patterns

Logical patterns allow you to combine patterns with logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`.

```csharp
object obj = 5;

if (obj is int number and > 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The number is a positive integer.");
}

if (obj is not null)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The object is not null.");
}
```

### Switch Expressions with Pattern Matching

Pattern matching shines when used in switch expressions, making them more powerful and expressive.

```csharp
object shape = new Circle(5);

string shapeDescription = shape switch
{
    Circle c => $"Circle with radius {c.Radius}",
    Rectangle r => $"Rectangle with width {r.Width} and height {r.Height}",
    _ => "Unknown shape"
};

Console.WriteLine(shapeDescription);
```

Here, `Circle` and `Rectangle` would be classes representing shapes, and the switch expression matches the type and extracts the relevant properties.

### Advanced Example: Complex Pattern Matching

Combining various pattern matching features, you can create very concise and readable code.

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

object obj = new Person { Name = "Bob", Age = 25 };

string description = obj switch
{
    Person { Name: "Alice", Age: 30 } => "This is Alice, 30 years old.",
    Person { Name: var name, Age: var age } when age < 18 => $"{name} is a minor.",
    Person { Name: var name, Age: var age } when age >= 18 => $"{name} is an adult.",
    _ => "Unknown person"
};

Console.WriteLine(description);
```

### Conclusion

Pattern matching in C# significantly enhances the language's expressiveness, making it easier to work with different types and conditions. By using pattern matching, you can write more readable, maintainable, and concise code, especially when dealing with complex data structures and conditions.
