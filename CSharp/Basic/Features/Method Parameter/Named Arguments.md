Named arguments in C# allow you to specify arguments for method parameters by name, rather than relying solely on the order of the parameters in the method signature. This can make method calls more readable and self-explanatory, especially when the method has many parameters or when you want to specify only some of the arguments.

Here's how you can use named arguments:

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public void PrintPersonInfo(string name, int age, string city)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, City: {city}");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();

        // Using named arguments
        obj.PrintPersonInfo(age: 30, name: "John", city: "New York");

        // You can mix named and positional arguments
        obj.PrintPersonInfo("Jane", city: "Los Angeles", age: 25);
    }
}
```

In this example:

- We have a method `PrintPersonInfo` that takes three parameters: `name`, `age`, and `city`.
- In the `Main` method, we call `PrintPersonInfo` using named arguments. By specifying the parameter names (`name:`, `age:`, `city:`), we can pass the arguments in any order we want, making the code more readable and self-documenting.
- You can also mix named arguments with positional arguments. However, named arguments must come after any positional arguments.

Named arguments provide flexibility and readability, especially when dealing with methods with many parameters or when you want to make the intent of the method call more explicit.
