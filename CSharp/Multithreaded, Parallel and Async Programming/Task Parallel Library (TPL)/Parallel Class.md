- A key class of the TPL is System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel. This class contains methods that allow you to iterate over a collection of data (specifically, an object implementing IEnumerable\<T>) in a parallel fashion, mainly through two primary static methods, Parallel.For() and Parallel.ForEach(), each of which defines numerous overloaded versions.
- These methods allow you to author a body of code statements that will be processed in a parallel manner. In concept, these statements are the same sort of logic you would write in a normal looping construct (via the for or foreach C# keyword). The benefit is that the Parallel class will pluck threads from the thread pool (and manage concurrency) on your behalf.
- Both methods require you to specify an IEnumerable- or IEnumerable\<T>-compatible container that holds the data you need to process in a parallel manner. The container could be a simple array, a nongeneric collection (such as ArrayList), a generic collection (such as List\<T>), or the results of a LINQ query.
- In addition, you will need to use the [[Func Delegate|System.Func<T>]] and [[Action Delegate|System.Action<T>]] delegates to specify the target method that will be called to process the data.
