- The most primitive of all types in the System.Threading namespace is Thread. This class represents an object-oriented wrapper around a given path of execution within an AppDomain. This type also defines several methods (both static and instance level) that allow you to create new threads within the current AppDomain, as well as to suspend, stop, and destroy a thread.
