- In many ways, working with ObservableCollection\<T> is identical to working with List\<T>, given that both of these classes implement the same core interfaces. What makes the ObservableCollection\<T> class unique is that this class supports an event named CollectionChanged. **This event will fire whenever a new item is inserted, a current item is removed (or relocated), or the entire collection is modified.**
