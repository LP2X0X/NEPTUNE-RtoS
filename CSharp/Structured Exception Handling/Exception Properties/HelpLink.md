- While the TargetSite and StackTrace properties allow programmers to gain an understanding of a given exception, this information is of little use to the end user. As you have already seen, the System.Exception. Message property can be used to obtain human-readable information that can be displayed to the current user. In addition, the HelpLink property can be set to point the user to a specific URL or standard help file that contains more detailed information.
- By default, the value managed by the HelpLink property is an empty string. Update the exception using object initialization to provide a more interesting value.
