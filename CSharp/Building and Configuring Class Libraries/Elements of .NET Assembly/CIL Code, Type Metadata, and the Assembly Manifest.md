- At its core, an assembly contains CIL code, which, as you recall, is a platform- and CPU-agnostic intermediate language. At runtime, the internal CIL is compiled on the fly using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, according to platform- and CPU-specific instructions. Given this design, .NET assemblies can indeed execute on a variety of architectures, devices, and operating systems. 
- An assembly also contains metadata that completely describes the format of the contained types, as well as the format of external types referenced by this assembly. The .NET Runtime uses this metadata to resolve the location of types (and their members) within the binary, lay out types in memory, and facilitate remote method invocations.
- An assembly must also contain an associated manifest (also referred to as assembly metadata). The manifest documents each module within the assembly, establishes the version of the assembly, and documents any external assemblies referenced by the current assembly. As you will see over the course of this chapter, the CLR makes extensive use of an assemblyâ€™s manifest during the process of locating external assembly references.
