- More than one configuration file can be added into the configuration system. When more than one file is used, the configuration properties are additive, unless any names of the name-value pairs conflict. **When there is a name conflict, the last one in wins.** To see this in action, add another file named appsettings.development.json, and set the project to always copy it to the output directory.
