In Vim, text objects and motions can be combined to navigate and manipulate text efficiently. Hereâ€™s a list of common motions and text objects similar to the `i` (inner) motion:

### Text Object Motions

   - **`i{`**: Inner content of curly braces `{}`.
   - **`i(`**: Inner content of parentheses `()`.
   - **`i[`**: Inner content of square brackets `[]`.
   - **`i"`**: Inner content of double quotes `""`.
   - **`i'`**: Inner content of single quotes `''`.
   - **`i>`**: Inner content of HTML/XML tags (e.g., `<tag>`).
   - **`i/*`**: Inner content of block comments in C-style (`/* comment */`).
   - **`i#`**: Inner content of a hash comment `#` (single-line comments).

2. **A (Around) Text Objects** (`a`):
   - **`a{`**: Includes the curly braces `{}`.
   - **`a(`**: Includes the parentheses `()`.
   - **`a[`**: Includes the square brackets `[]`.
   - **`a"`**: Includes the double quotes `""`.
   - **`a'`**: Includes the single quotes `''`.
   - **`a>`**: Includes the HTML/XML tags.
