Marks in Vim are used to **save positions** in your files so you can quickly jump back to them. There are different types of marks, both local and global, that can be set and used within a session. Here’s an overview of all mark-related features and commands in Vim:

### Types of Marks

1. **Lowercase Marks (`a-z`)**:
   - These are **file-specific** marks.
   - You can set them in one file, and they won’t be accessible from other files.
   - They are persistent across sessions if the `viminfo` option is enabled.

2. **Uppercase Marks (`A-Z`)**:
   - These are **global marks**, meaning they can be accessed from any file.
   - When set, these marks also record the file they were placed in, allowing you to jump to the exact line and file.

3. **Special Marks**:
   - **`'`** and **`` ` ``**: These refer to the last position of the cursor before the most recent jump.
   - **`''`** or **``` `` ``**: Jump back to the position before the last jump within the same file.
   - **`[ and ]`**: Refer to the beginning (`[`) and end (`]`) of the most recent change.
   - **`< and >`**: Refer to the beginning (`<`) and end (`>`) of the most recent visual selection.

4. **Numbered Marks (`0-9`)**:
   - These refer to the positions in the files you’ve edited most recently.
   - **`'0`**: The cursor position when Vim was last exited.
   - **`'1` – `'9`**: Positions from previously edited files, with `'1` being the last closed file.

5. **Quickfix Marks (`'Q`)**:
   - Mark associated with the quickfix list, used to track error locations.

### Commands for Setting and Using Marks

1. **Set a Mark**:
   - To set a mark, use **`m`** followed by a letter (e.g., `ma` sets mark "a").
   
2. **Jump to a Mark**:
   - To jump to a mark:
     - Use **`'a`** to jump to the start of the line where mark "a" is set.
     - Use **`` `a` ``** to jump to the exact column where mark "a" is set.

3. **Delete Marks**:
   - To delete a specific mark:
     ```
     :delmarks a
     ```
   - To delete multiple marks at once:
     ```
     :delmarks a b c
     ```
   - To delete all marks:
     ```
     :delmarks!
     ```

4. **List All Marks**:
   - To see a list of all current marks in the file:
     ```
     :marks
     ```

5. **Jump to Last Position in File**:
   - To jump to where you last left off when reopening a file:
     ```
     '0
     ```

6. **Jump Back to Previous Position**:
   - To jump back to where the cursor was before the last jump:
     ```
     ''
     ```

7. **Jump Between Changes**:
   - To jump to the beginning of the last change:
     ```
     '[ 
     ```
   - To jump to the end of the last change:
     ```
     '] 
     ```

8. **Jump to Last Insert Position**:
   - To return to the place where the last insert command occurred:
     ```
     `^
     ```

9. **Use Global Marks**:
   - To jump to a global mark in another file:
     ```
     'A
     ```

### Practical Examples
- **Set a mark and return later**:
  - Place the cursor where you want to set a mark and type `ma`.
  - Continue editing and type `'a` to jump back to the line where you set mark "a".
  
- **Using a mark to navigate between files**:
  - Set a global mark with `mA` in file1.
  - Open file2, then use `'A` to jump back to file1 at the exact location where mark "A" was set.

### Persistent Marks Across Sessions
- Marks are persistent between Vim sessions if you have the `viminfo` option enabled. You can check and set this option in your `.vimrc`:
  ```
  set viminfo='20,\"50
  ```

Marks are a powerful tool in Vim, especially for long editing sessions where you need to return to specific locations within and across files.
