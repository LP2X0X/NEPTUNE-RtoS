- The range of a Visual mode selection is marked by two ends: one end is fixed and the other moves freely with our cursor. We can use the o key to toggle the free end. This is really handy if halfway through defining a selection we realize that we started in the wrong place. Rather than leaving Visual mode and starting afresh, we can just hit o and redefine the bounds of the selection.
