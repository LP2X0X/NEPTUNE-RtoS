The terms **x32**, **x64**, and **x86** refer to different CPU architectures and their corresponding software compatibility. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### ✅ **1. x86 (32-bit architecture)**

- **What it means:** Originally referred to **32-bit** processors based on the **Intel 8086** architecture.
- **Compatibility:**
    - Can run **32-bit** software.
    - Cannot run **64-bit** applications.
- **Memory Limit:** Can only address **up to 4 GB** of RAM.
- **Use Case:** Older systems and lightweight devices.

👉 **"x86" generally means 32-bit**—even though it technically refers to the entire Intel 8086 family.

### ✅ **2. x64 (64-bit architecture)**

- **What it means:** Refers to **64-bit** processors based on the **x86-64** architecture (developed by AMD and Intel).
- **Compatibility:**
    - Can run **64-bit** and **32-bit** software (with a compatibility layer).
    - Cannot run **16-bit** applications (used in very old systems).
- **Memory Limit:** Can theoretically address **up to 18 exabytes** of RAM (practical limits depend on OS).
- **Use Case:** Modern computers and applications that need **more memory and processing power**.

👉 **x64 is 64-bit** and supports better performance and larger memory than x86.

### ✅ **3. x32 (Uncommon Hybrid Mode)**

- **What it means:** **32-bit software running on a 64-bit kernel**. It allows a balance between performance and memory use.
- **Compatibility:**
    - Runs **32-bit** applications in a **64-bit** environment.
    - Limited adoption—mainly in Linux systems.
- **Memory Limit:** Supports **more than 4 GB** of memory without the overhead of full 64-bit pointers.
- **Use Case:** Specialized Linux environments to save memory while benefiting from 64-bit capabilities.

### 🧐 **Which One Should You Use?**

- **x86 (32-bit)** – For very old systems or specific legacy software.
- **x64 (64-bit)** – **Recommended for most modern systems** (better performance and compatibility).
- **x32 (Hybrid)** – Rarely used outside of specific technical applications (mainly Linux).
