Abstract Stream Members Member Meaning in Life CanRead Determines whether the current stream supports reading, seeking, and/or writing. CanlWrite CanSeek Close() Closes the current stream and releases any resources (such as sockets and file handles) associated with the current stream. Internally, this method is aliased to the Dispose() method; therefore, closing a stream is functionally equivalent to disposing a stream. Flush() Updates the underlying data source or repository with the current state of the buffer and then clears the buffer. If a stream does not implement a buffer, this method does nothing. Length Returns the length of the stream in bytes. Position Determines the position in the current stream. Read() Reads a sequence of bytes (or a single byte) from the current stream and advances the ReadByte() current position in the stream by the number of bytes read. ReadAsync() Seek() Sets the position in the current stream. Setlength() Sets the length of the current stream. Write() Writes a sequence of bytes (or a single byte) to the current stream and advances the WriteByte() current position in this stream by the number of bytes written.
