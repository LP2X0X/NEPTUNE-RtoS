Pointer-centric C# Operators and Keywords Operator/Keyword ~ Meaning in Life * This operator is used to create a pointer variable (i.e., a variable that represents a direct location in memory). As in C++, this same operator is used for pointer indirection. & This operator is used to obtain the address of a variable in memory. -> This operator is used to access fields of a type that is represented by a pointer (the unsafe version of the C# dot operator). [1 This operator (in an unsafe context) allows you to index the slot pointed to by a pointer variable (if you're a C++ programmer, you will recall the interplay between a pointer variable and the [ ] operator). + - In an unsafe context, the increment and decrement operators can be applied to pointer types. + - In an unsafe context, the addition and subtraction operators can be applied to pointer types. ==, 1=,Â¢,>, <=, => In an unsafe context, the comparison and equality operators can be applied to pointer types. Stackalloc In an unsafe context, the stackalloc keyword can be used to allocate C# arrays directly on the stack. Fixed In an unsafe context, the fixed keyword can be used to temporarily fix a variable so that its address can be found.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
