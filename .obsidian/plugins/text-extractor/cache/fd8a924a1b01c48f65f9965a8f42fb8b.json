Select Members of System.MulticastDelegate/System.Delegate Member Meaning in Life Method This property returns a System.Reflection.MethodInfo object that represents details of a static method maintained by the delegate. Target If the method to be called is defined at the object level (rather than a static method), Target returns an object that represents the method maintained by the delegate. If the value returned from Target equals null, the method to be called is a static member. Combine() This static method adds a method to the list maintained by the delegate. In C#, you trigger this method using the overloaded += operator as a shorthand notation. GetInvocationList() This method returns an array of System.Delegate objects, each representing amethod that may be invoked. Remove() / RemoveAll() These static methods remove a method (or all methods) from the delegateâ€™s invocation list. In C#, the Remove () method can be called indirectly using the overloaded -= operator.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
