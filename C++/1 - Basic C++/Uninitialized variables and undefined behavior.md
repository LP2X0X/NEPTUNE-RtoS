- When a variable that is not initialized is given a memory address to use to store data, the default value of that variable is whatever value happens to be already be in that memory address.

- Code implementing undefined behavior may exhibit _any_ of the following symptoms:
	- Your program produces different results every time it is run.
	- Your program consistently produces the same incorrect result.
	- Your program behaves inconsistently (sometimes produces the correct result, sometimes not).
	- Your program seems like itâ€™s working but produces incorrect results later in the program.
	- Your program crashes, either immediately or later.
	- Your program works on some compilers but not others.
	- Your program works until you change some other seemingly unrelated code.
	- Or, your code may actually produce the correct behavior anyway.
