- A **null statement** is an expression statement that consists of just a semicolon:

```cpp
if (x > 10)
    ; // this is a null statement
```

- `Null statements` do nothing. They are typically used when the language requires a statement to exist but the programmer doesnâ€™t need one. For readability, `null statements` are typically placed on their own lines.
