- **Normal termination** means the program has exited in an expected way. Note that the term `normal termination` does not imply anything about whether the program was successful (that’s what the `status code` is for). For example, let’s say you were writing a program where you expected the user to type in a filename to process. If the user typed in an invalid filename, your program would probably return a non-zero `status code` to indicate the failure state, but it would still have a `normal termination`.
