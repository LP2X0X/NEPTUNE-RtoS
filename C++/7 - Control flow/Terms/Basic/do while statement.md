- A **do while statement** is a looping construct that works just like a while loop, except the statement always executes at least once. After the statement has been executed, the do-while loop checks the condition. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the path of execution jumps back to the top of the do-while loop and executes it again.

```cpp
do
    statement; // can be a single statement or a compound statement
while (condition);
```
