- The best way to tell the compiler to look in a particular namespace for an identifier is to use the **scope resolution operator** (::). The scope resolution operator tells the compiler that the identifier specified by the right-hand operand should be looked for in the scope of the left-hand operand.
```ad-note
The scope resolution operator can also be used in front of an identifier without providing a namespace name (e.g. `::doSomething`). In such a case, the identifier (e.g. `doSomething`) is looked for in the global namespace.
```

```ad-note
Itâ€™s legal to declare namespace blocks in multiple locations (either across multiple files, or multiple places within the same file). All declarations within the namespace are considered part of the namespace.
