An inline namespace in C++ is a feature that allows you to declare a namespace in such a way that its contents are automatically available in the parent namespace, without requiring explicit qualification with the inline namespace's name. This feature is particularly useful for versioning in libraries, where different versions of a library can coexist, and users can access the latest version by default without needing to specify the version explicitly.

### **Key Concepts of Inline Namespace**

1. **Automatic Injection into Parent Namespace**:
   - When a namespace is declared as `inline`, all its members (functions, variables, classes, etc.) are automatically made available in the enclosing (parent) namespace. This means that you don't need to prefix the members with the inline namespace's name when accessing them.

2. **Versioning and Compatibility**:
   - Inline namespaces are often used in libraries to manage different versions of an API. You can define multiple versions within a namespace and mark the latest version as `inline`, making it the default for users. Older versions can still be accessed explicitly if needed.

3. **Selective Override**:
   - If the same function or variable exists in both the parent namespace and an inline namespace, the version in the parent namespace will override the one in the inline namespace.

### **Example of Inline Namespace**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

namespace MyLibrary {
    inline namespace v2 {
        void printMessage() {
            std::cout << "Hello from version 2!" << std::endl;
        }

        class Feature {
        public:
            void show() {
                std::cout << "Feature from version 2!" << std::endl;
            }
        };
    }

    namespace v1 {
        void printMessage() {
            std::cout << "Hello from version 1!" << std::endl;
        }

        class Feature {
        public:
            void show() {
                std::cout << "Feature from version 1!" << std::endl;
            }
        };
    }
}

int main() {
    MyLibrary::printMessage(); // Calls the version 2 function
    MyLibrary::Feature feature;
    feature.show(); // Uses the version 2 class

    MyLibrary::v1::printMessage(); // Explicitly calls the version 1 function
    MyLibrary::v1::Feature oldFeature;
    oldFeature.show(); // Uses the version 1 class

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of the Example**

- **Inline Namespace**:
  - The `v2` namespace is declared as `inline` within the `MyLibrary` namespace. This means that all functions and classes within `v2` are accessible directly through `MyLibrary` without needing to specify `v2::`.

- **Versioning**:
  - The example demonstrates how different versions of functions and classes (`v1` and `v2`) can coexist. The user accesses the latest version (v2) by default (implicity), thanks to the `inline` keyword, but can still access the older version (`v1`) explicitly if needed.

- **Overriding**:
  - If a user defines a function or variable in the `MyLibrary` namespace that matches a name in the inline namespace `v2`, the user-defined version would take precedence.

### **Use Cases for Inline Namespace**

1. **Library Versioning**:
   - Inline namespaces are particularly useful in library development, where you want to maintain backward compatibility while allowing users to access the latest features without needing to update their code with new namespace qualifiers.

2. **API Evolution**:
   - When evolving an API, you can use inline namespaces to introduce new versions of functions or classes while keeping the older versions available. This makes it easier to deprecate old features gradually.

3. **Cleaner API Design**:
   - Inline namespaces help in keeping the API clean by making the latest version the default while still providing access to previous versions when necessary.

### **Summary**

An inline namespace in C++ is a powerful feature that simplifies the management of different versions of functions, classes, and other entities within a namespace. By marking a namespace as `inline`, you allow its members to be automatically accessible in the parent namespace, making it easier to update libraries and APIs while maintaining backward compatibility. This feature is particularly useful for versioning in libraries, where you want to provide seamless access to the latest version of your API.
