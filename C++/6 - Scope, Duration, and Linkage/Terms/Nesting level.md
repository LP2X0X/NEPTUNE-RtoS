- The **nesting level** (also called the **nesting depth**) of a function is the maximum number of nested blocks you can be inside at any point in the function (including the outer block). In the above function, there are 4 blocks, but the nesting level is 3 since in this program you can never be inside more than 3 blocks at any point.
- The C++ standard says that C++ compilers should support 256 levels of nesting -- however not all do (e.g. as of the time of writing, Visual Studio supports fewer).
- Itâ€™s a good idea to keep your nesting level to 3 or less. Just as overly-long functions are good candidates for refactoring (breaking into smaller functions), overly-nested blocks are hard to read and are good candidates for refactoring (with the most-nested blocks becoming separate functions).
