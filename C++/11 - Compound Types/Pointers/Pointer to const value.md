- A **pointer to a const value** (sometimes called a `pointer to const` for short) is a (non-const) pointer that points to a constant value.
- To declare a pointer to a const value, use the `const` keyword before the pointerâ€™s data type:

```cpp
int main()
{
    const int x{ 5 };
    const int* ptr { &x }; // okay: ptr is pointing to a "const int"

    *ptr = 6; // not allowed: we can't change a const value

    return 0;
}
```

- However, because a pointer to const is not const itself (it just points to a const value), we can change what the pointer is pointing at by assigning the pointer a new address:

```cpp
int main()
{
    const int x{ 5 };
    const int* ptr { &x }; // ptr points to const int x

    const int y{ 6 };
    ptr = &y; // okay: ptr now points at const int y

    return 0;
}
```

- Just like a reference to const, a pointer to const can point to non-const variables too. A pointer to const treats the value being pointed to as constant, regardless of whether the object at that address was initially defined as const or not:

```cpp
int main()
{
    int x{ 5 }; // non-const
    const int* ptr { &x }; // ptr points to a "const int"

    *ptr = 6;  // not allowed: ptr points to a "const int" so we can't change the value through ptr
    x = 6; // allowed: the value is still non-const when accessed through non-const identifier x

    return 0;
}
```
