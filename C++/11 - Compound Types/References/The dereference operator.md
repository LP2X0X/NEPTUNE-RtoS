- The most useful thing we can do with an address is access the value stored at that address. The **dereference operator** (*) (also occasionally called the **indirection operator**) returns the value at a given memory address as an lvalue:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    std::cout << x << '\n';  // print the value of variable x
    std::cout << &x << '\n'; // print the memory address of variable x

    std::cout << *(&x) << '\n'; // print the value at the memory address of variable x (parentheses not required, but make it easier to read)

    return 0;
}
```
