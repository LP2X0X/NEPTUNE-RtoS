- Inside the body of a class, a **friend declaration** (using the `friend` keyword) can be used to tell the compiler that some other class or function is now a friend. In C++, a **friend** is a class or function (member or non-member) that has been granted full access to the private and protected members of another class. In this way, a class can selectively give other classes or functions full access to their members without impacting anything else.
