- Since references to an object act just like the object itself, we can also use the member selection operator (.) to select a member from a reference to a struct:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Employee
{
    int id{};
    int age{};
    double wage{};
};

void printEmployee(const Employee& e)
{
    // Use member selection operator (.) to select member from reference to struct
    std::cout << "Id: " << e.id << '\n';
    std::cout << "Age: " << e.age << '\n';
    std::cout << "Wage: " << e.wage << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    Employee joe{ 1, 34, 65000.0 };

    ++joe.age;
    joe.wage = 68000.0;

    printEmployee(joe);

    return 0;
}
```

- However, the member selection operator (.) canâ€™t be used directly on a pointer to a struct. But, C++ offers a **member selection from pointer operator (->)** (also sometimes called the **arrow operator**) that can be used to select members from a pointer to an object:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Employee
{
    int id{};
    int age{};
    double wage{};
};

int main()
{
    Employee joe{ 1, 34, 65000.0 };

    ++joe.age;
    joe.wage = 68000.0;

    Employee* ptr{ &joe };
    std::cout << ptr->id << '\n'; // Better: use -> to select member from pointer to object

    return 0;
}
```
