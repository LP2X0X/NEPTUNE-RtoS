- An **enumeration** (also called an **enumerated type** or an **enum**) is a compound data type whose values are restricted to a set of named symbolic constants (called **enumerators**).
- An _enumerator_ is a specific named value belonging to the enumeration (e.g. `red`).

- There are two types of enumeration:
	- [[Unscoped Enum]]
	- [[Scoped Enum]]
