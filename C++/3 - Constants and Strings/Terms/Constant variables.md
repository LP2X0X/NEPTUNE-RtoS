- In programming, a **constant** is a value that may not be changed during the programâ€™s execution.
- C++ supports two different kinds of constants:
	- **Named constants** are constant values that are associated with an identifier. These are also sometimes called **symbolic constants**, or occasionally just **constants**.
	- **Literal constants** are constant values that are not associated with an identifier.
