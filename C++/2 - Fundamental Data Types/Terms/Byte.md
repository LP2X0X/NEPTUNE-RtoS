- Perhaps surprisingly, in modern computer architectures, each bit does not get its own unique memory address. This is because the number of memory addresses is limited, and the need to access data bit-by-bit is rare. Instead, each memory address holds 1 byte of data. A **byte** is a group of bits that are operated on as a unit. The modern standard is that a byte is comprised of 8 sequential bits.
