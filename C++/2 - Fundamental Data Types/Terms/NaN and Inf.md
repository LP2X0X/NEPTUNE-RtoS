- There are two special categories of floating point numbers:
	- The first is **Inf**, which represents infinity. Inf can be positive or negative.
	- The second is **NaN**, which stands for “Not a Number”. There are several different kinds of NaN (which we won’t discuss here). 
- NaN and Inf are only available if the compiler uses a specific format (IEEE 754) for floating point numbers.
