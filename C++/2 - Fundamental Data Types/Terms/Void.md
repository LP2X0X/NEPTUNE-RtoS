- Void is our first example of an incomplete type. An **incomplete type** is a type that has been declared but not yet defined. The compiler knows about the existence of such types, but does not have enough information to determine how much memory to allocate for objects of that type. `void` is intentionally incomplete since it represents the lack of a type, and thus cannot be defined.
