- The fast types (std::int_fast#_t and std::uint_fast#_t) provide the fastest signed/unsigned integer type with a width of at least # bits (where # = 8, 16, 32, or 64). For example, _std::int_fast32_t_ will give you the fastest signed integer type that’s at least 32 bits. By fastest, we mean the integral type that can be processed most quickly by the CPU.
- The least types (std::int_least#_t and std::uint_least#_t) provide the smallest signed/unsigned integer type with a width of at least # bits (where # = 8, 16, 32, or 64). For example, _std::uint_least32_t_ will give you the smallest unsigned integer type that’s at least 32 bits.
