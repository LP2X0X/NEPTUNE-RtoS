- For backwards compatibility reasons, many C++ compilers support **multicharacter literals**, which are char literals that contain multiple characters (e.g. `'56'`). If supported, these have an implementation-defined value (meaning it varies depending on the compiler). Because they are not part of the C++ standard, and their value is not strictly defined, multicharacter literals **should be avoided**.
