- An **expression** is a non-empty sequence of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that calculates a value. The process of executing an expression is called **evaluation**, and the resulting value produced is called the **result** of the expression.
```ad-note
Expression are always evaluated as part of statements.
```

````ad-example
```cpp
int x{ 2 + 3 }; // 2 + 3 is an expression that has no semicolon -- the semicolon is at the end of the statement containing the expression
```
If you were to break this statement down into its syntax, it would look like this:

`type identifier { expression };`

_type_ could be any valid type (we chose `int`). _identifier_ could be any valid name (we chose `x`). And _expression_ could be any valid expression (we chose `2 + 3`, which uses two literals and an operator).

- An **Expression statement** is a statement that consists of an expression followed by a semicolon. When the expression statement is executed, the expression will be evaluated.
- When an expression is used in an expression statement, any return value generated by the expression is discarded (because it is not used).

- A **subexpression** is an expression used as an operand. For example, the subexpressions of `x = 4 + 5` are `x` and `4 + 5`. The subexpressions of `4 + 5` are `4` and `5`.
- A **full expression** is an expression that is not a subexpression. All three expressions above (`2`, `2 + 3`, and `x = 4 + 5`) are full expressions.
- In casual language, a **compound expression** is an expression that contains two or more uses of operators. `x = 4 + 5` is a compound expression because it contains two uses of operators (`operator=` and `operator+`). `2` and `2 + 3` are not compound expressions.
