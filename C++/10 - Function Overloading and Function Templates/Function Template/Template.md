- In C++, the template system was designed to simplify the process of creating functions (or classes) that are able to work with different data types.
- Instead of manually creating a bunch of mostly-identical functions or classes (one for each set of different types), we instead create a single _template_. Just like a normal definition, a **template** describes what a function or class looks like. Unlike a normal definition (where all types must be specified), in a template we can use one or more placeholder types. A placeholder type represents some type that is not known at the time the template is written, but that will be provided later.
