- There are a few other member functions that are often useful:
	- size() returns the number of bits in the bitset.
	- count() returns the number of bits in the bitset that are set to `true`.
	- all() returns a Boolean indicating whether all bits are set to `true`.
	- any() returns a Boolean indicating whether any bits are set to `true`.
	- none() returns a Boolean indicating whether no bits are set to `true`.
